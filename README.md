## Installation
This code needs python 3 or latest in order to be executed and was developed jupyter notebook using existing python libraries.

## File desciption
The is a notebook that has the step by step of how I predicted the results. From the visualization, to the data cleaning and 
finally the data modeling.

## Motivation

HR-turnover data was used to assist me to predict the employees that are likely to leave the company.It looks at the factors that can push people to leave, why there is a higher turnover with younger employees, and finally the departments that seem to have a high turnover rate.
All the questions can assist HR to mediate on time to the decrease the turnover rate, have strategies to increase customers satisfaction. 

## Results 
The main findings of the dataset can be found ont the medium blog [here](https://medium.com/@letelelimpho3/employee-turnover-prediction-987f8e455126).

## Licensing,Authors,Acknowledgements
I woule like to thank Udacity for making this practical execises and kaggle for providing the dataset.
